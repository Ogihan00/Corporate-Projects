### Project Overview

Coffee House Simulator (originally Tea House Simulator) is a **highly detailed, realistic, and fully localized simulation and management game**, developed by a **small, focused team of three** at Wack Games.  

Imagine managing your own coffeehouse in a **living, breathing city**: balancing economic pressures and inflation, increasing your revenue through trading and the stock market, and responding to the dynamic life of the city—from chasing thieves and avoiding municipal inspections to handling bills and hosting concerts.  
Discover diverse locations, from basketball courts to market squares, and interact with systems that make the city feel alive.  

During the project, I was responsible for **all programming tasks**, including gameplay mechanics, AI behaviors, economy systems, inventory management, and interactive elements. The project spanned **approximately 10 months**, making it the most extensive and complex development effort I have undertaken.  
It required **constant iteration, close team coordination**, and a deep understanding of **gameplay system integration**, resulting in a polished, commercial-ready product released on Steam.
